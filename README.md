# School_District_Analysis

## Purpose 
The focus of our fourth module brought together the basic knowledge we have built so far using python, and programming language through a handful of different envionrments. Through the combination of jupyter notebook as well as the pandas and numpy libraries, we recieved two csv's breaking down a school districts dataset for their student's math and reading test scores. Early practice in the module helped us better understand how to clean, sort, and analyze it to help better understand how our code could effectively translate the numbers and measurments that represent the dataset. Once our challenge began, the emphasis was focused on first cleaning out certain scores that were deemed to be altered and therefore illegitimate due to academic dishonesty. For the entire 9th grade at Thomas High School, math and reading scores would need to be unincluded before further analysis of the district began. 

From there, the purpose of our analysis was to extract and get a good understanding of the numbers each school totaled that would end up representing the entire district. Key variables included total school budget, average math score, average reading score, as well as the percentages of student body at each school that scored a passing grade.
